# Analysis-of-Seattle-Bird-Sounds-Deep-Learning

## Goal:

Train neural network models to identify bird species from audio recordings using spectrograms.

## Tasks:

* Collect and preprocess audio recordings from the Xeno-Canto Bird Sound Archive.
* Extract spectrograms from audio clips for 12 bird species.
* Develop binary and multi-class classification models using neural networks.
* Evaluate the models on predicting bird species from Seattle bird call clips.
* Analyze model performance and address challenges such as biases and computational limitations.
  
## Tools:

* Python
* TensorFlow and Keras for neural network development
* Audio processing libraries for spectrogram extraction
* Data preprocessing and visualization tools

## Results:

* Binary classification model achieved over 95% test accuracy in distinguishing between ‘amecro’ and ‘barswa’ species.
* Multi-class classification model exhibited accuracy of 67.24%, indicating the complexity of multi-species identification.
* Identified the need for model and dataset improvements to enhance multi-species classification performance.
